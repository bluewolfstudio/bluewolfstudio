    <h2 class="game-title">Case 17</h2>
    <p class="game-description">It was a cold, rainy night, the kind of night that seemed made for hiding secrets. The streets of New Haven were nearly deserted and dark except for the intermittent twinkle of streetlights. In a forgotten corner of the city, an old building creaked due to gusts of wind. Inside, the office of Thomas Archer, private investigator, was a refuge of order amidst the chaos. The walls were covered with newspaper clippings and photographs, traces of past cases solved. The phone rang, breaking the silence. "Archer Investigations," he replied in his gravelly voice. "Mr. Archer, we need your help," said a shaky female voice on the other end of the line. "Something terrible has happened."<br>
    And so it all began. A mystery as thick as the fog that night. A case that would take Thomas on a journey through places full of secrets, dangers and hidden truths.<br>
    Welcome to the world of "Case 17". Will you be able to help Thomas Archer reveal the truth hidden behind the shadows of the night?</p>
